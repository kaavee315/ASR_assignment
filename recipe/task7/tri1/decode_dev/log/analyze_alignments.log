The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 89.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 15.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 6.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,24.8,43)
